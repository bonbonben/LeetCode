# Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
# Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
# It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

                continue

                left += 1
                nums[left] = nums[i]
