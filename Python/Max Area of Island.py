# Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)
# You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
# Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

# [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
#  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
#  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
#  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
# Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

# Depth-First Search (Recursive)
# time complexity: O(R*C), where R is the number of rows in the given grid, and C is the number of columns. We visit every square once.
# space complexity: O(R*C), the space used by seen to keep track of visited squares, and the space used by the call stack during our recursion.
